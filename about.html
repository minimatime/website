        <h1>Let me tell you a story.</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I made one of the scariest decisions of my life in April 2020 when I decided I was not going to college. Constrained to my house in the tiny streets of suburbanian Hyderabad, I did not know what I was doing with my life. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>The best thing is to know what you want to do, but the second best thing is to know what you do not want to do. </h3>
        <br>
        <p>I got on calls at 4 AM, attended workshops hosted across the globe, participated in hackathons from universities I could only dream of going to. I applied for hundreds of apprenticeships and internships, with nothing on my resume but a clear motivation: I will learn as much as I can. 

            <br><br>Today, I write this from the comfort of my seat in the little library cafe on campus, experiencing and working towards opportunities I could never fathom and friends I never expected. I’m oceans away from home, working to solve problems that seemed larger than life. 
            
            <br><br>I still don’t know what I want to do, but I love what I’m doing, as I always have.  
            
            <br><br>My name is Natasha and I'm a developer and designer studying computer science and interaction design in a unique major called Computational Media at Georgia Tech. The roots of my passion stem from my curiosity and love for storytelling, community building and interactive experiences. Born and raised in Hyderabad, India, studying in Atlanta, Georgia and with work experience in different parts of the globe through the Global Citizen Year Academy, Kulfi Beauty, AIonSpectrum and WiTech, I believe in creating local change for global problems through technology, community and design.</p>
